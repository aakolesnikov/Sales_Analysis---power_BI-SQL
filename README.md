# Business Request & User Stories
The main request was an executive sales report for sales management team. Power BI dashboard was created condisering several user's stories:

1) "Follow up my customers that buys the most and who we can sell more to" --- filtering data by customers
2) "Follow up my products which sells the most" --- filtering data by product 
3) "Folow sales over time against budget" --- graphs and KPIs comparing against budget
